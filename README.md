# Pidris-webiste

I'm so proud of my village's "simple" website, which I created independently and voluntarily because of my wish to learn the website creating.  Every pixel looks exactly like I wish.

Used website creating technology:
-HTML
-CSS
-JS
-BOOTSTRAP

Images and the text can be better, changes will be done in the future because it is very complex to get perfect images in the perfect time and the place, which best describes the culture, place, and people of the village.
